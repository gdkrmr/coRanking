#' Methods for the co-ranking matrix
#'
#' coRanking provides methods for the calculation of the co-ranking
#' matrix and derived measures to assess the quality of a
#' dimensionality reduction
#'
#' This package provides functions for calculating the co-ranking
#' matrix, plotitng functions and some derived measures for quality
#' assessment of dimensionality reductions.
